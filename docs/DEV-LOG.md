## ‚úÖ Summary of Progress

Tonight marked a major milestone in structuring, validating, and deploying our GBStudio x LangFlow development stack. Here's a breakdown of everything we've accomplished:

---

### üß± Project Infrastructure

- **Cleaned the repo structure** using `clean_structure.sh` and validated with `validate_structure.mjs` to ensure only the necessary files remain under version control.
- **Created symlinks** (`flows`, `vectorstore`, `logs`) between the Vite project and LangFlow environment to unify state and simplify agent access.
- **Updated `.gitignore`** to prevent virtualenvs, build artifacts, and logs from polluting GitHub.
- Successfully **bootstrapped the repo** using `bootstrap_and_deploy.sh` and confirmed live deployment via GitHub Pages.

---

### üß† LangFlow Integration

- Created an isolated **`langflow-venv`** using `uv` and installed LangFlow 1.4.2 cleanly.
- Confirmed LangFlow launches successfully via `python -m langflow run`.
- Audited and version-locked installation to avoid memory bloat and dependency creep.
- Placed Gantt-style flowcharts and org chart diagrams into `/docs/` to assist agent clarity.
- Defined the expectation that **Agents must defer to the org chart** if overwhelmed.

---

### üéÆ Game Development Stack

- Set up **OpenEMU** for playtesting `.gb` files.
- Integrated **GBStudio CLI**, debugged broken Electron dependencies, and patched webpack build with `--openssl-legacy-provider`.
- Connected the human-in-the-loop review logic between PM Agent and user: PM filters submissions, then collaborates directly with you before triggering advancement or feedback.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why This Works

- ‚úÖ **Modularity:** Each component (LangFlow, GBStudio, OpenEMU, Vite UI) is isolated but interconnected through symlinks and validated interfaces.
- ‚úÖ **Human-in-the-loop:** Prevents hallucinations or runaway agents. All outputs pass through a PM filter.
- ‚úÖ **Repeatable DevOps:** CLI scripts (`bootstrap`, `test-build.sh`) ensure we can reproduce this environment from scratch.
- ‚úÖ **State clarity:** Symlinks unify working directories between LangFlow agents and the core build assets.

---

## üîú Next Steps

1. **Write `.rules` files** for the PM Agent and each department. Prioritize clear, enforceable delegation logic.
2. **Finalize LangFlow flow nodes** and import them to the environment.
3. **Hook up `test-build.sh` to LangFlow** so QA Agent can auto-run it and report back.
4. **Define `qa.rules`** and mock up first QA review document.
5. **Generate GBStudio `.gbsproj` file** with proper scenes, then assign departments to populate their scenes.
6. **Enable PM Agent to launch GBStudio GUI** for visual inspection.
7. **Begin drafting `KB.md`** for the in-universe documentation used by Agents.
8. **Deploy PM Agent interaction log system** (LangFlow memory + log store entry).

üõ†Ô∏è Everything is in motion. No garbage, no clutter. Agents are coming online.

## ‚úÖ Summary of Progress (2025-06-19)

Today we introduced the basic automation hub layout.

- Added a `docker-compose.yml` that spins up LangFlow, Ollama and ComfyUI so the environment can be run with a single command.
- Created placeholder directories (`agent_memory`, `langflow_graphs`, `project_files`, `project_docs`) with `.gitkeep` files so new contributors know where data will live.
- Implemented the first LangFlow custom component `DepartmentOrchestrator` under `langflow_components/`.
- Downloaded a starter GBStudio project file for `game/barry-sharp.gbsproj`.
- Replaced the broken `gbstudio-cli` symlink with a regular folder holding a README to explain where the patched CLI should go.
- Wrote a simple README with step-by-step instructions for running the stack.

These changes make it possible for anyone with Docker installed to bring up the agents and begin creating LangFlow graphs without extra setup.
