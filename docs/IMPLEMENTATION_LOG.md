# Implementation Log

## Plans Going Forward (2025-06-19)

- **Automate LangFlow graph creation.** We need to build and save starter graphs for each department agent. These will be stored in `langflow_graphs/` so new users can load them directly.
- **Document the art and music workflows.** Write short guides in `project_docs/` describing how the Art and Music departments should create and review assets.
- **Integrate the GBStudio CLI.** Once the patched CLI is placed in `gbstudio-cli/`, we will add scripts that trigger builds from within the PM agent.
- **Set up basic tests.** A small script should check that Docker containers start and that essential directories exist. This will help catch missing dependencies early.
